{"name":"check with graphite","tagline":"Nagios / Icinga checks based on graphite data collected by collectd or jmxtrans","body":"### Welcome to check_graphite suite\r\nUsing graphite as the main data source for your monitoring leaves you with almost no tools to alert you on failure.\r\n\r\nThe combination of collectd agents running on your host and graphite/carbon/whipser on you monitoring server is small and also quite easy to setup.\r\n\r\nIf you're using icinga2 there is already some graphite support but only for storing performance data.\r\n\r\nWe would like to use graphite as a data source. Collectd e.g. pushes metric to graphite, like disk usage, swap, mem, load. On the monitoring server we can use a check such as check_graphite (several different options here) to query the data.\r\n\r\nThis is very unflexible. Imagine your data is spread over a few different counters and needs to be aggregated. E.g. load, with collectd there 3 values (1min,5min,15min as usual), check_graphite scripts usually can only test one value or sum or average multiple values.\r\n\r\nThe script in this repository are special scripts to query graphite. Because querying graphite is so easy, we just write a dedicated script for each check we like to have.\r\n\r\nFor example the check_df script pulls all disks and calculates the size.\r\n\r\nThese check are easy to integrate into icinga/nagios\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
